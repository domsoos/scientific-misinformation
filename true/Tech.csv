0,Reuters Summit-Software Executives See More Mergers,(Corrects spelling name in 15th paragraph),2005-03-03T21:41:12+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-software-merg/corrected-reuters-summit-software-executives-see-more-mergers-idUSN0229520220050303," (Corrects spelling name in 15th paragraph)   By Wei Gu   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Software vendors say they are being forced to consolidate by business customers who are frustrated by increasing complexity and clamoring for one-stop shopping.   Siebel Systems, Sybase Inc., Computer Associates International Inc. and Symantec Corp. said at the Reuters Technology Summit that they saw mergers continuing in the sector.   “Customers are looking at a smaller number of vendors to do business with,” said Veritas Chief Executive Gary Bloom, whose company was recently bought by Symantec for $13.5 billion. “They would love to reduce the complexity of managing and interacting with multiple vendors.”   Making different software work together is always a challenge. Companies that are able to address different technology problems have an edge over pure players because clients like to be able to hold one company responsible if something goes wrong, analysts said.   “Our customers have a laundry list of companies they want us to acquire,” Christopher Lochhead, chief marketing officer of Mercury Interactive, told Reuters. “We are nowhere near done bulking up our products portfolio.”   A spate of large deals swept the industry late last year. Business software maker Oracle Corp. acquired PeopleSoft for $10 billion after a bitter takeover battle.   Siebel Systems in December agreed to buy edocs, an electronic billing and customer services company.   The trend is expected to continue.   “Will there be consolidations in the applications space?” Siebel CEO Mike Lawrie told Reuters. “Absolutely.”   Symantec, the leading security software maker, has appetite for more deals after digesting storage software provider Veritas. Integration could take six months to a year, executives said.   “It is logical for you to assume that we will continue to be acquisitive,” Symantec CEO John Thompson said. “My sense is we’ll continue to look at small things.”   Despite getting a cold shoulder from investors, chief information officers are more bullish on the Veritas deal, according to a Merrill Lynch survey.   Thompson said the CIO of a large Wall Street firm told him that he thought the acquisition was “very smart.”   Symantec’s rival Computer Associates told Reuters the company would do more deals this year and is interested in management software and identity-control products.   Mercury President and Chief Operating Officer Tony Zingale said the company plans to do larger and more aggressive acquisitions this year.   Certain parts of the software industry are especially fragmented and ripe for consolidation. For example, the average enterprise now has eight different security vendors, according to Nitsan Hargil, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey.   “Every IT manager out there would like to deal with fewer vendors than more,” Hargil said.

1,nplays On-Line Movie Delivery,"Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Wednesday downplayed prospects for online delivery of movies, saying licensing snarls with movie studios would hold up consumer adoption long after the technology becomes widely available.",2005-03-03T14:16:03+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-netflix-onlin/netflix-downplays-on-line-movie-delivery-idUSN0248510920050303," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Wednesday downplayed prospects for online delivery of movies, saying licensing snarls with movie studios would hold up consumer adoption long after the technology becomes widely available.   Hastings said Netflix, the online DVD rental leader, expects the DVD format to dominate movie distribution for years to come as studios work out business plans for online distribution.   “Media formats are led by not what people want but format profitability,” he said.   As long as movie studios are reaping huge profits — as much as $15 per DVD — from DVD sales that totaled more than $14 billion last year, studios have little incentive to adopt online or on demand delivery models that will pay them far less, Hastings said.   “We recognized that DVD would dominate for ... 10 to 15 to 20 years,” he said. “That won’t last forever. Eventually piracy will rise and the movie industry will allow more downloading to people like us.”   Netflix plans to set aside 1 percent to 2 percent of revenues in the next five years to make way for online delivery on “several platforms,” including a pact already signed with TiVo, Hastings said.   The company, based in Los Gatos, California, plans to roll out limited online delivery later this year. “We will launch something this year and it will be totally underwhelming,” he said.   “Our view is that we don’t want to end up with the AOL irony,” in which the Internet service provider failed to recognize the importance of broadband before it became mainstream.   Hastings said Netflix is betting that online delivery of films won’t take off “for a couple of years, and that allows us to grow very large on the DVD side.”   With a target subscriber base of 20 million, Netflix could fend off competition for online download services by what will likely be a wide range of competitors, from Comcast Corp. to Walt Disney Co., while negotiating licensing agreements, he said.   Netflix is betting that online download capability will penetrate the market relatively slowly, making it necessary for online rental companies to bridge the technology gap.   “Consumers would choose a service that gave them downloading on the movies that were enabled for that and DVDs on the movies that were not,” he said. “That would be the differentiator during the transition period.”   Among the possible projects the company may consider during the transition to online delivery was adding original content, he said.

2,mit-Quotes from the Reuters Tech Summit: Wednesday,The final day of the Reuters Technology Summit on Wednesday saw executives from the worlds of media and networking discussing their businesses and challenges for the future.,2005-03-02T23:13:42+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-quotes-dc/reuters-summit-quotes-from-the-reuters-tech-summit-wednesday-idUSN0223882720050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The final day of the Reuters Technology Summit on Wednesday saw executives from the worlds of media and networking discussing their businesses and challenges for the future.   Below are some of their comments:    “What was the point of lowering the price? It had a very specific goal ... to drive a lot of the easy profits out of the marketplace. If Amazon doesn’t enter, we will feel enormously gratified that our strategy worked” — Netflix Inc. CEO Reed Hastings on price cuts and potential competition from Amazon.com Inc.     “An implicit trust model no longer works. You can’t trust 2 billion people” — Cisco Chief Technology Officer Charles Giancarlo on security challenges.    “We’ve been saying for years there’s money to be made at the low end of the market. We’re going to continue to bother with the low-end and we’re going to continue to do well” — Nokia CFO Rick Simonson on lower-priced phones.  “While Wall Street reacted more lukewarm to the deal than we might have anticipated, customers and employees have been more than enthusiastic about it” — Symantec Corp. Chairman and CEO John Thompson on their merger with Veritas Software Corp. .    “I think history will prove that we’re more complementary, in the same way that people like Microsoft and Intel and Oracle (together) became part of the IT infrastructure” — Juniper Networks CEO Scott Kriens on their relationship to Cisco Systems Inc..

3,mit-Cell Phones Seen Challenging Sony Game Handheld,"Cell phone video games will rival games on mainstream handhelds like the Sony Corp. PSP by late 2006, executives of some of the top phone game publishers said on Wednesday.",2005-03-02T23:10:38+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-games-dc/reuters-summit-cell-phones-seen-challenging-sony-game-handheld-idUSN0247049420050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cell phone video games will rival games on mainstream handhelds like the Sony Corp. PSP by late 2006, executives of some of the top phone game publishers said on Wednesday.   The cost and complexity of developing such games makes consolidation inevitable, the chief executives of private publishers Sorrent and In-Fusio and top mobile executives of Electronic Arts Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. said in a panel discussion at the Reuters Technology Summit.   Handhelds like Sony Corp.’s PSP and Nintendo Co. Ltd.’s DS currently far outstrip cell phones in terms of graphics capability and processing power. But before long, those executives said, phones will be equal to the challenge.   “We think if we track those out we’re looking at devices pushing PSP kind of quality in late 2006, early 2007,” said John Batter, general manager of EA Mobile.   And his peers suggested that when that happens, most people will be more likely to carry one device.   “I think it is a reasonable bet that if you are going to carry one device it is going to be a phone device from your phone company,” said Larry Shapiro, general manager of Disney Mobile. Disney’s ESPN is launching its own brand of cell phone service later this year.   While objective figures are somewhat hard to come by, Gilles Raymond, the co-CEO of In-Fusio, suggested the wireless games market was a 1.6 billion euro ($2.11 billion) business worldwide, with 75 percent growth in 2005 over 2004 and 60 percent growth in 2006 over 2005.   Dealing with all that growth effectively means smaller players must combine to survive, the executives said.   “Everybody who’s in this business recognizes there’s going to be consolidation,” said Greg Ballard, CEO of Sorrent. “The struggle for a company like ours is that we stay above the water and become a consolidator rather than a consolidatee.”    Much of the cost in the wireless game business at the moment is in porting — the process of making a game work on different phones. Because handsets are so different, each game must be reprogramed for each phone — as many as 150 different models now and potentially up to 200 by the end of 2005.   At a cost of about $1,000 to $2,000 per port, the obstacle is significant.   “I call it the worst barrier to entrance,” In-Fusio’s Raymond said.   Most of the speakers called porting their worst difficulty, except for Ballard, who said Sorrent was actually set up to have expertise and ability in fast, high-volume porting.   “That has been one of our compelling advantages in the marketplace,” he said. “In an ideal world the complexity continues until everybody goes out of business except us.”   For the future, the panel saw the mobile games market maturing into a full-fledged business with operating margins of anywhere from 20 percent to 30 percent.   But as with anything in wireless, they also agreed that much of the game market’s future success depends on the willingness of the carriers to help.   “It is a painful process and carriers are largely in a position to help accelerate or decelerate the growth of the market,” EA’s Batter said.

4,mit-Nokia Minds Its Finances But Open to Big Deals,"Mobile phone maker Nokia, which boasts of one of the strongest balance sheets in the world of high tech, would be prepared to take on more risk to finance potential mergers, a top executive said on Wednesday.",2005-03-02T23:02:45+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-nokia-dc/reuters-summit-nokia-minds-its-finances-but-open-to-big-deals-idUSN0248616220050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Nokia, which boasts of one of the strongest balance sheets in the world of high tech, would be prepared to take on more risk to finance potential mergers, a top executive said on Wednesday.   “We’ve always wanted to make sure that we have financial flexibility to execute on our current business, and should we find any opportunities that we think would be value-creating, we could do acquisitions,” Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson told the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   The Finnish mobile phone giant has been reluctant to use its cash or stock to fund large deals, preferring to invest heavily in research and development of new products while making occasional small technology acquisitions.   But rapid consolidation sweeping across the U.S. technology sector from telecommunications to computer hardware and software has forced every major company to review its openness to deal-making so as not to be eclipsed by bigger players.   “I think we have the flexibility to do whatever would be feasible,” he said of his appetite for big deals. “We don’t have any acquisitions to announce, so I can’t tell you anything.”   Echoing comments from other leading gear makers such as Cisco Systems Inc., Simonson said the global telecommunications market has been long overdue for a shakeout, with too much research and too many products chasing falling demand.   But he said the industry has proved enormously resistant to a major consolidation to shrink the number of players that might help the industry become more profitable.    Nokia held 11.8 billion euros, or US$15.4 billion, in cash and securities last year — the third-richest cash position in high tech after Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. .   This allows Nokia to buy back its shares aggressively while paying the highest dividend in the wireless equipment sector.   Simonson, a former investment banker, said he has long opposed taking on large amounts of debt just because its blue-chip corporate status would allow it to do so.   Reflecting its financial strength and the cleanest balance sheet of any global technology company, Nokia has negative net debt and also negative gearing, the ratio of debt to equity.   But he said he wanted to remain flexible in taking on debt if business opportunities presented themselves.   “We’re not going to be a slave to some magic gearing number,” Simonson said.   The first priority for cash is to fund more than $3 billion a year in research and development and also to finance marketing programs to expand its brand globally, he said.   However, critics say Nokia has been overly cautious in taking advantage of its balance sheet to invest in new business prospects.   Managing cash flow levels and generating additional cash at the company, which produced nearly 200 million phones last year, is the company’s biggest priority, Simonson said. Nokia focuses on cash flow rather than profit margins, even though it commands the highest margins in the industry by all measures.  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

5,mit-Software Executives See More Mergers,Software vendors say they are being forced to consolidate by business customers who are frustrated by increasing complexity and clamoring for one-stop shopping.,2005-03-02T22:07:24+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-software-merg/reuters-summit-software-executives-see-more-mergers-idUSN0229520220050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Software vendors say they are being forced to consolidate by business customers who are frustrated by increasing complexity and clamoring for one-stop shopping.   Siebel Systems, Sybase Inc., Computer Associates International Inc. and Symantec Corp. said at the Reuters Technology Summit that they saw mergers continuing in the sector.   “Customers are looking at a smaller number of vendors to do business with,” said Veritas Chief Executive Gary Bloom, whose company was recently bought by Symantec for $13.5 billion. “They would love to reduce the complexity of managing and interacting with multiple vendors.”   Making different software work together is always a challenge. Companies that are able to address different technology problems have an edge over pure players because clients like to be able to hold one company responsible if something goes wrong, analysts said.   “Our customers have a laundry list of companies they want us to acquire,” Christopher Lochhead, chief marketing officer of Mercury Interactive, told Reuters. “We are nowhere near done bulking up our products portfolio.”   A spate of large deals swept the industry late last year. Business software maker Oracle Corp. acquired PeopleSoft for $10 billion after a bitter takeover battle.   Siebel Systems in December agreed to buy edocs, an electronic billing and customer services company.   The trend is expected to continue.   “Will there be consolidations in the applications space?” Siebel CEO Mike Lawrie told Reuters. “Absolutely.”   Symantec, the leading security software maker, has appetite for more deals after digesting storage software provider Veritas. Integration could take six months to a year, executives said.   “It is logical for you to assume that we will continue to be acquisitive,” Symantec CEO John Thompson said. “My sense is we’ll continue to look at small things.”   Despite getting a cold shoulder from investors, chief information officers are more bullish on the Veritas deal, according to a Merrill Lynch survey.   Thompson said the CIO of a large Wall Street firm told him that he thought the acquisition was “very smart.”   Symantec’s rival Computer Associates told Reuters the company would do more deals this year and is interested in management software and identity-control products.   Mercury President and Chief Operating Officer Tony Zingdale said the company plans to do larger and more aggressive acquisitions this year.   Certain parts of the software industry are especially fragmented and ripe for consolidation. For example, the average enterprise now has eight different security vendors, according to Nitsan Hargil, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey.   “Every IT manager out there would like to deal with fewer vendors than more,” Hargil said.

6,"mit-Symantec, Veritas Shrug Off Merger Skepticism","Symantec Corp., the top maker of computer security software, and Veritas Software Corp. on Wednesday dismissed investor skepticism of their $13.5 billion merger and said they expected to integrate the companies in less than a year after the deal closes.",2005-03-02T22:06:41+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-symantec-veri/reuters-summit-symantec-veritas-shrug-off-merger-skepticism-idUSN0248150720050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Symantec Corp., the top maker of computer security software, and Veritas Software Corp. on Wednesday dismissed investor skepticism of their $13.5 billion merger and said they expected to integrate the companies in less than a year after the deal closes.   Symantec Chairman and Chief Executive John Thompson said the combined company would probably do more small acquisitions in the future after Symantec and Veritas, a top maker of data storage management software, have successfully integrated.   “My sense is that we’ll continue to look at small things, but in terms of large transactions, we are not focused there at all,” Thompson said at the Reuters Technology Summit here.   Veritas Chief Executive Gary Bloom said integrating the two companies could take between six and 12 months, during which time they would not be inclined to consider other acquisitions. The deal is expected to close this summer.   Asked if there was anything to cause Symantec, known for its Norton anti-virus software, to abandon its acquisition of Veritas, Thompson said, “Nothing at all.”   “While Wall Street reacted more lukewarm to the deal than we might have anticipated, customers and employees have been more than enthusiastic about it,” Thompson said.   Many investors have questioned the logic of Symantec’s acquisition, pushing the share prices of both companies sharply lower.   Symantec has said the aim of the deal, announced in December, was to give it a broader product line and help companies cut costs by using one supplier to blend security with data management.   The deal will also give Symantec a stronger foothold in the corporate software market and a sales staff at Veritas that is trained to sell to larger companies.   Thompson said he was “comfortable” with Symantec’s current fourth-quarter outlook given on Jan. 19.   Symantec on Jan. 19 forecast revenue between $690 million and $710 million for its fourth quarter ending April 1 and earnings, excluding items, of 24 cents a share. That outlook topped Wall Street estimates at the time.    Bloom will be vice-chairman and president of the combined company, which would be the fourth largest software company in the world by revenues.   Thompson stuck to a “high-teens” sales growth target for the combined company in fiscal year 2006, but said he would be let down if the company did not perform better.   “Personally, I’d be disappointed if that’s all we deliver,” he said about the 2006 sales outlook.   Analysts forecast fiscal 2006 revenues of $3.08 billion   versus fiscal year 2005 sales of $2.58 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.   Symantec’s stock is down about 34 percent since early December, though analysts have said the weaker share price is a buying opportunity given the strong demand for computer security software products and the continued threat of Internet viruses.   Thompson said a combined product offering of the two companies could be rolled-out nine months to 15 months after the deal closes, but said cross-selling of Symantec and Veritas products would start immediately after the acquisition closes.   The combined company was still considering its cash strategy but is likely to continue buying back shares, Thompson said, adding the strategy would be put into place after the company’s board is assembled. That will happen once the deal is closed, he said.   “Both companies have been aggressive repurchasers ... And I don’t expect that to change,” Thompson said.

7,ced to Forgo Profit for 5 Yrs if Needed,"Online DVD rental leader Netflix Inc. is prepared to sacrifice profits for up to five years in order to win up to 20 million U.S. subscribers and fend off major rivals such as Blockbuster and Amazon.com, its CEO said on Wednesday.",2005-03-02T20:53:14+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-netflix-dc/netflix-braced-to-forgo-profit-for-5-yrs-if-needed-idUSN0247288620050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Online DVD rental leader Netflix Inc. is prepared to sacrifice profits for up to five years in order to win up to 20 million U.S. subscribers and fend off major rivals such as Blockbuster and Amazon.com, its CEO said on Wednesday.   Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Netflix, the pioneer of online DVD rental, could capture as much as 20 percent of the U.S. market by extending the strategy it embarked on in October to run at break-even while spending heavily on marketing.   “Correct,” Hastings said when asked if he was prepared to sacrifice profitability for as much as five years in order to reach 20 million customers, up from 2.6 million currently. “That’s true. We haven’t given any guidance on it, so therefore, it’s possible,” he told the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   “We can prove that it’s a rational investment because we spend between $35 and $38 per subscriber,” Hastings said, referring to the cost of gaining new customers. The typical Netflix customer subscribes for about two years and generates $100 of profit on average, he said.   Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, expenses its subscriber marketing costs in the quarter in which they are incurred, in contrast to the breakneck spending during the dot-com boom of the 1990s when many online services spent without accounting for such costs.   Analysts had been expecting the company to post net losses in the coming two years, according to a consensus of analysts by Reuters Estimates.   Netflix is in the midst of an aggressive price war with Blockbuster, which offers customers unlimited DVDs, three at a time, plus coupons for in-store use for $14.99 a month. Netflix offers comparable service, with no store coupons, for $17.99.   Hastings has been predicting that online retailer Amazon.com would enter the U.S. online rental market shortly. Amazon launched an online rental service in Britain in December.   He said Netflix aimed to capture 20 percent of the 100 million U.S. households that own DVD players.

8,dent as Rival Offers Cheap Phones,"Mobile phone maker Nokia expects that a new $40 phone from rival Motorola Inc. will do little to dent its dominant -- and highly profitable -- position in the low-cost phone market, Nokia's chief financial officer said on Wednesday.",2005-03-02T18:51:54+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-nokdia-cheapp/nokia-confident-as-rival-offers-cheap-phones-idUSN0227650420050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Nokia expects that a new $40 phone from rival Motorola Inc. will do little to dent its dominant — and highly profitable — position in the low-cost phone market, Nokia’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday.   “We’ve been saying for years there’s money to be made at the low end of the market,” Rick Simonson, Nokia’s CFO, said at the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco, when asked about the expected impact of the new Motorola phone and the viability of the low-end phone market. .   “We’re going to continue to bother with the low-end and we’re going to continue to do well,” said Simonson, noting that 20 percent of Nokia’s profit from mobile phones comes from models priced at 100 euros or less.   “Obviously we must have our pricing right,” he said.   Simonson’s remarks follow last month’s announcement by Motorola, Nokia’s biggest rival, that it planned to enter the low-price market with a phone selling for under $40 and aimed at burgeoning wireless markets such as Asia and Latin America.   Motorola’s new $40 phone is slightly cheaper than Nokia’s low-end phones, a market that generally refers to phones costing under $50.   Nokia is the main supplier of low-end phones, but analysts have speculated that the Motorola announcement, which includes plans to manufacture 6 million inexpensive phones later this year, could prompt a price war.   Simonson said that Nokia has some 40 new phone models in various price ranges due to launch in 2005. It has launched six new models within recent weeks, and plans more flip-phones as well as the possibility of a phone that includes a hard drive. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Cisco is the world’s largest maker of equipment to route Internet traffic.   The company has done more than 80 acquisitions since 1993, though many of those deals have been smaller in scope, either financially or in terms of the size of operations acquired. In fact, Giancarlo lampooned some of the attention Cisco gets for its acquisition strategy.   “I’m always amazed about the rumors that we’re just about to buy XYZ,” he said.

10,nfazed by Sluggish European Growth,"Recent economic data showing that European growth could be sluggish this year has not influenced Nokia's outlook for the year, the chief financial officer of the world's biggest mobile phone maker said on Wednesday.",2005-03-02T18:49:29+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-nokia-europe/nokia-cfo-unfazed-by-sluggish-european-growth-idUSN0227466020050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Recent economic data showing that European growth could be sluggish this year has not influenced Nokia’s outlook for the year, the chief financial officer of the world’s biggest mobile phone maker said on Wednesday.   “In 2004 (European growth) was certainly less than robust, but the market for infrastructure and handsets was quite robust in Europe,” Nokia CFO Rick Simonson said at the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   “We’ve made our view of the 2005 outlook for both devices and infrastructure ... saying the conditions that existed in 2004 largely look to be repeated ... globally,” he added.   “We are not seeing any major changes economically that would cause us to shift our view.”   Nokia expects the global handset market to grow by around 10 percent in unit volumes in 2005, and at a slower pace than that in terms of value. It sees the market for network infrastructure up slightly in euro terms.   Europe remains a key market for the company, with the U.K. and Germany among its most important in terms of sales.   Fresh euro zone data on Wednesday showed that output stumbled in the latter half of 2004. Accordingly, analysts expect the European Central Bank to revise down its growth forecast for 2005 and 2006.   Eurostat reported that gross domestic product growth slowed to a 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter rate in both the third and fourth quarters, robbing the economy of momentum into early 2005.   On Asia, Simonson said that Nokia would be largely unscathed if China’s yuan currency were allowed to float more freely at “reasonable” levels.   The United States has urged Beijing to allow its currency to move more freely. It complains that the yuan, also called the renminbi, is undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage in U.S. markets by keeping the dollar price of their exports cheap.   “If there was a revaluation, a valuation up of the renminbi, in the ranges that people would say would be reasonable, it would have an immaterial effect on Nokia,” Simonson said.

11,"M&A Likely, Telecom May Lead Charge","Consolidation is warranted in nearly every sector of the technology industry, but telecommunications is likely to lead the charge out of sheer necessity, according to executives from some of the leading U.S. technology companies.",2005-03-02T18:48:44+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-consolidation/broad-tech-ma-likely-telecom-may-lead-charge-idUSN0225801820050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Consolidation is warranted in nearly every sector of the technology industry, but telecommunications is likely to lead the charge out of sheer necessity, according to executives from some of the leading U.S. technology companies.   Telecom hardware makers, struggling with a shrinking customer base as telecom service providers merge, could be forced to execute deals of their own this year, executives predicted at the Reuters Technology Summit.   Some of the biggest players in the sector like Nortel Networks Corp., Motorola Inc. and Siemens AG haven’t resized their businesses to reflect their smaller customer base and their supply chains and product lines aren’t correctly oriented, said Flextronics International Ltd. Chief Executive Michael Marks.   “This is why this is the year that the telecom hardware guys have to merge, there’s just not enough growth in the market,” Marks said.   Corning Inc. Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said he’d been expecting consolidation in both the telecommunications service provider and hardware-making segments for quite a while.   “I’d be stunned if a year from now, there wasn’t more,” Flaws said.   But in the optical fiber-making industry — one of the sectors in which Corning competes — Flaws saw little, if any, pending merger activity. While there are around eight competitors in the sector, many of them are parts of bigger companies and none is showing a willingness to give leeway or sell out to their competitors, he said.   The electronics manufacturing services sector (EMS) could see some merger activity this year, the executives said, though the urgency isn’t quite as strong.   “We are not at the place yet where we’re forced to merge because we don’t have any revenue growth, which is really where the telecom carriers are — and the telecom hardware companies,” Marks said.   There may be room for a deal within the next year or two between EMS market leaders including Flextronics, Sanmina-SCI Corp., Solectron Corp., Celestica Inc. or Jabil Circuit Inc., but activity is even more likely among the market’s smaller players.   Marks said investors are skeptical about the maturing EMS industry, where once-rapid end-market growth has sagged and trading multiples have contracted based on fears over growth in the future.   “To an investor, this is still a sloppy industry,” he said. “There’s almost certainly going to be some M&A in our space.”   The number of EMS players could shrink from around 12 today to as few as eight, Marks predicted, and deal flow particularly among the smaller firms could start this year.   “I’d expect some consolidation,” Celestica CEO Stephen Delaney agreed, though he felt it was more likely to happen if pricing dynamics shifted as too many competitors competed for little or no growth.   “But are we there yet? It kind of feels like it’s a little bit too early,” Delaney said.   Marks said Flextronics had no current plans to be acquisitive because it’s busy absorbing the purchase of Nortel’s manufacturing operation. But he also said Flextronics’ balance sheet is cleaner than those of some of its rivals.   “I’m not saying we wouldn’t participate when the time comes,” Marks said.   The semiconductor sector is also likely to condense over the longer term, Micron Technology Inc. CEO Steve Appleton said, although he said the recent recovery would probably deter deals for this year, at least. Micron, the No. 2 global computer memory chip maker, isn’t likely to be one of the assets acquired, he added.   “I think the probabilities are high there will be continuing consolidation all the way down the curve,” Appleton said. “If the market were to collapse any time soon, you absolutely would see a consolidation occur.”   He pointed to South Korea’s Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and Germany’s Infineon Technologies as two potential takeover targets and said Micron would look at acquisition opportunities if any became clear. Micron and Hynix have held talks over a merger in the past.

12,s by N-Gage Despite Troubles,"Finnish cell phone giant Nokia will stand by its N-Gage gaming phone despite the device's slow adoption by the market, and even as the company broadens gaming throughout its phone lineup, Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson said Wednesday.",2005-03-02T17:59:11+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-nokia-ngage-d/nokia-sticks-by-n-gage-despite-troubles-idUSN0246060920050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Finnish cell phone giant Nokia will stand by its N-Gage gaming phone despite the device’s slow adoption by the market, and even as the company broadens gaming throughout its phone lineup, Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson said Wednesday.   Despite competition in the handheld game market from the likes of Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. Ltd., Simonson said it made sense for Nokia to have both a dedicated gaming phone as well as gaming features in its broader lineup.   “We are a product company. That’s a virtue, not an evil,” Simonson told the Reuters Technology Summit. “How we’re going to play the gaming business across the whole portfolio is what you need to keep an eye on, and part of that is including with the N-Gage game decks, obviously.”   The N-Gage was introduced in 2003 to broad derision in the games industry. Gaming fans did not like that they had to turn the unit off and remove the battery to change games, and phone users did not like the setup for making phone calls.   A new version in 2004, the N-Gage QD, fixed many of those problems and achieved wider distribution in the United States, but it remained something of an afterthought in the industry compared to handhelds from Nintendo and Sony.   “Our approach to this is, let’s continue to take what we’ve learned, what we’ve done right, and where we need to make corrections, and that’s in retail, in games development and in the deck itself,” Simonson said.   He said the volume of N-Gage sales to date was “somewhat disappointing” but not entirely bad compared to other gaming product launches of the past. Nokia has sold about 1.5 million N-Gages to date.   “Mobile gaming is here to stay, the question is how the value chain is created and who can take advantage of it,” he said.   Simonson also acknowledged there had been management changes in the N-Gage unit. Gerard Weiner took the helm of the unit earlier this year and will meet with the gaming community at next week’s Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Simonson declined to discuss the changes in detail.  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

13,y Mull Dividend Before Annual Meeting,"Qualcomm Inc. holds its annual shareholder meeting next week and the board of directors may evaluate its dividend policy ahead of it, a top executive said.",2005-03-02T15:52:30+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-qualcomm-divi/qualcomm-may-mull-dividend-before-annual-meeting-idUSN0141011120050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc. holds its annual shareholder meeting next week and the board of directors may evaluate its dividend policy ahead of it, a top executive said.   “We view the dividend as the No. 1 way to return capital to shareholders. To the extent feasible, we’ll continue to expand the dividend,” Tony Thornley, chief operating officer of the wireless chipmaker, said at the Reuters Technology Summit on Tuesday.   Qualcomm surprised investors two years ago, ahead of its annual meeting, by becoming one of the first major, rapidly growing high-tech companies to introduce a dividend. Last year at the company’s annual meeting in March, it boosted the dividend by 40 percent and then raised it another 40 percent last July.   It held its quarterly rate steady at 7 cents per share when it reported results in January.   “The dividend policy is a board matter. We did update it a year ago at the shareholder meeting. Certainly you should listen to what we say at the shareholder meeting,” Thornley, said.   Qualcomm ranks among the top 20 tech companies in terms of its cash holdings, with around $8.0 billion on hand at the end of 2004, according to a study of cash positions of the world’s top 2,000 technology companies by Reuters Estimates. Qualcomm generated $2.1 billion in additional cash in calendar 2004.   Thornley also said the company expected to pick up the pace of its share buybacks.   Two years ago, the company’s board authorized the company to buy back $1 billion worth of its shares. Qualcomm has been slow to make use of the share authorization, having only repurchased $150 million in stock early on.   “Going forward, we will do more stock buybacks than we have. So it will be a combination of dividends and stock buybacks,” Thornley said.   Shares of Qualcomm, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split last August, rose steadily from mid-2003 until the end of 2004, reaching nearly $45 from the mid-teens. The stock fell back in January to trade in the mid-$30s. It closed at $36.36, up 31 cents on Tuesday. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

14, Stock Buybacks After Nextel Deal,"Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider, could consider buying back some of its shares as a way to use cash once its acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc. is over, Sprint Chief Operating Officer Len Lauer said.",2005-03-02T15:26:04+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-sprint-buybac/sprint-eyes-stock-buybacks-after-nextel-deal-idUSN0165277220050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider, could consider buying back some of its shares as a way to use cash once its acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc. is over, Sprint Chief Operating Officer Len Lauer said.   Sprint, which plans to buy rival Nextel this year, will preserve cash for a time after the deal in case it is needed for potential deal related obligations, Lauer said on late Tuesday.   But in months following the merger, Sprint will have to consider what to do with its cash, he said.   Asked whether Sprint would use cash to pay down debt,  Lauer told the Reuters Technology Summit, “I think the bigger issue (to consider) will be share buybacks.”   But there may be other needs for cash in the mean time.   For example, Nextel Partners Inc, which is about 30 percent owned by Nextel and sells Nextel-branded services, could require Sprint to buy it out as a result of the Nextel deal.   Sprint could also need cash to resolve potential breaches of non-compete agreements with its own affiliates, which sell services under the Sprint brand in many markets where the Nextel-brand services are also available.   Options cited by analysts include anything from a Sprint purchase of its affiliates, which include companies such as Alamosa and US Unwired Inc., to an exchange of customers between Nextel Partners and affiliates.   While Sprint has made no decisions so far, Lauer said the company would like to keep its affiliate program in place.   Sprint has long had a policy of paying dividends and plans to pay 12.5 cents per share on March 31. The last time it raised its dividend was in 1984.   Both Sprint and Nextel have both shaved billions of their debt burdens in recent years. Sprint ended 2004 with $12.6 billion in net debt. Nextel had about $8.5 billion in debt.

15,ices Firms Eye U.S. Acquisitions,"Fast-growing Indian outsourcing and services companies are considering acquiring U.S. assets to gain quick access to new technology, but cultural differences and integration challenges have forestalled large deals.",2005-03-02T14:50:19+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-services-merg/indian-services-firms-eye-u-s-acquisitions-idUSN0137974220050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Fast-growing Indian outsourcing and services companies are considering acquiring U.S. assets to gain quick access to new technology, but cultural differences and integration challenges have forestalled large deals.   Indian services providers such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Technologies Ltd., and Wipro Ltd. have established themselves as competent providers of low-profit-margin services such as software maintenance, payroll processing and call center management.   They are now fighting for a larger slice of more lucrative work such as software development, technology consulting and enterprise software implementation.   “If they want to move up the food chain, this is the way — to buy customer relationships,” Bhanu Singh, a partner at management consulting firm Bain & Co., said at the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco. “You will see more Indian services companies buying U.S companies.”   Shares of Indian companies are hovering at multi-year highs as the firms have shown 40 percent to 50 percent annual revenue growth.   But do not expect the Indian companies to splurge.   “Indian companies are frantic about how much they want to pay because of their low cost model,” Singh added.   Indian firms have started with acquisitions mostly smaller than $100 million.   Arup Gupta, U.S. chief executive of Tata Consultancy, told the summit that his company already had workers around the world and did not anticipate large acquisitions just to increase its presence in a particular geography.   “But we do want to fill in the gaps we have in technology such as grid computing and utility computing,” he said.   Grid computing and utility computing involve sharing computers and is a key part of computer resource outsourcing where customers can contract for scalable resources from outside providers.   Indian companies have refrained from large deals because cross-border services mergers are difficult to carry out, analysts said.   IBM’s sale of its PC business to China’s Lenovo Group has set an example for Chinese and Indian companies to buy U.S. assets. But merging a U.S. firm into an Indian services company is more problematic, analysts said.   “Cultural challenges in merging services companies are quite significant, greater than the hurdles involved in selling off a product business to a foreign company,” Rod Bourgeois, an analyst with Bernstein, said.   Security is a major concern. U.S. services companies generate a big chunk of their revenues from the federal government for work such as managing tax files for the Internal Revenue Service and printing money in Iraq. Foreigners are generally barred from working on those sensitive assignments.   “I know people are thinking about it, looking at it,” Kevin Campbell, global managing director of business process outsourcing at Accenture, said. “It is harder than it appears.”  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

16,s Itself Unaffected by Telco Mergers,"Corning Inc., the world's largest maker of fiber optic cable, expects a flurry of big telephone carrier mergers will not strongly affect its business despite expectations that the phone company deals will spark consolidation among equipment vendors.",2005-03-02T03:06:44+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-corning-dc/corning-sees-itself-unaffected-by-telco-mergers-idUSN0138085520050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Corning Inc., the world’s largest maker of fiber optic cable, expects a flurry of big telephone carrier mergers will not strongly affect its business despite expectations that the phone company deals will spark consolidation among equipment vendors.   “We are staying away from M&A right now,” James Flaws, Corning’s chief financial officer, said on Tuesday during a three-day Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   But he added, “We’ve frankly been expecting for some time more consolidation in the telecommunications industry, both on the equipment side and on the provider side.”   In the optical fiber-making industry, where Corning dominates, Flaws saw little if any pending merger activity, however.   While there are around eight competitors in the sector, many of them are parts of bigger companies and none are showing a willingness to sell out to their competitors, he said.   Instead of searching for deals, the diversified technology manufacturer, which trimmed staff, shuttered plants and restructured operations following the telecommunications downturn three years ago, aims to cut its debt, currently $2.6 billion, to below $2.0 billion this year, he said.   It currently has $1.9 billion in cash.   “We are very focused on getting back to being investment grade,” he said.   Flaws added that if Corning were to generate excess cash, it might consider instituting share buybacks. The company does not pay dividends.   One of the largest of the proposed telephone deals, Verizon Communications’ planned $6.7 billion buyout of MCI Inc., is unlikely to have an impact on Corning if it is approved, Flaws said.   Corning is a key vendor for Verizon’s roll-out of high-speed fiber-to-the-home cable.   “Our feeling is it (the deal) won’t impact us at all,” he said. “The question is whether it’s a distraction for them (Verizon) more than anything else.”   Corning, which has been expanding into growth areas such as flat panel screens used in computers, said supplies of LCD glass in the first quarter were tight. Corning previously predicted that prices would drop only a relatively small 5 percent from the previous quarter because of the tight supply.   “There clearly will still be price declines,” he said, adding that “we think the volume will be overcoming the price declines.”   The business, fueled by growth in notebook computers and other electronic devices, remains a growth driver for Corning, he said, as the company continues to reduce production costs. Including a joint venture, glass last year accounted for $2.2 billion in sales. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2022 Reuters.

17,nveil Mobile Security Features,"Sprint wireless phone users who lose their mobile devices will be able to have the handsets shut down so that no one can access their phone numbers and other data inside, the company's president said on Tuesday.",2005-03-02T01:25:53+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-sprint-securi/sprint-to-unveil-mobile-security-features-idUSN0140155620050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sprint wireless phone users who lose their mobile devices will be able to have the handsets shut down so that no one can access their phone numbers and other data inside, the company’s president said on Tuesday.   As part of new security features that Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, will make available this year, the company will also provide anti-virus software updates “over the air” to users as new viruses targeting handheld devices are released, President and Chief Operating Officer Len Lauer told the Reuters Technology Summit.   Wireless device makers are adding security features to phones in the face of a small but growing threat of mobile phone viruses.   The Sprint security features, to be showcased at an industry conference next week, will be available initially only for business customers.   “We’re real excited about this offering. There have been a lot of concerns from customers” about the rise of mobile virus threats, Lauer said, adding that the security features stem from a pilot program Sprint has been running with 12 corporate customers.   Business customers will also be able to protect their mobile devices with passwords that block access to their devices, which increasingly contain loads of personal information, and to change those passwords as needed, Lauer said.   Cabir, the world’s first mobile phone virus “in the wild,” spread to the United States in February after surfacing nine months ago in the Philippines. Cabir has many variants and generally drains cell phone batteries.   The mobile-virus threat is small at the moment but will grow in the future as virus writers become more sophisticated and phones standardize on technologies that make it easier for viruses to spread across not just specific devices but the whole industry.

18,ees Muted 1st-Half Demand,Celestica Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Delaney said on Tuesday he expects growth in the electronics markets served by his company and its clients to be weaker in the first half than a year earlier.,2005-03-02T01:21:09+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-celestica-dc/celestica-sees-muted-1st-half-demand-idUSN0138644220050302," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Celestica Inc.  Chief Executive Stephen Delaney said on Tuesday he expects growth in the electronics markets served by his company and its clients to be weaker in the first half than a year earlier.   Celestica, the world’s No. 4 contract electronics manufacturer, makes electronic parts for such companies as IBM, Cisco, Sun Microsystems and Lucent.   “I don’t see the first half of 2005 looking as good as the first half of 2004 looked,” Delaney said at the Reuters Technology Summit.   “The basic principle that we’re all working with, meaning us and our customers, is that we’re probably seeing end-market growth in the low single-digit range for the first half of the year,” he said. “Nobody’s radar is any good past that.”   While some industry analysts predict a second-half recovery, Delaney said he thinks it is too early to tell. As a result he said he is keeping operations at his Toronto-based company at “fighting weight” rather than expanding capacity.   Delaney said one cap on growth was the cautious spending patterns of major companies when it comes to upgrading technology like servers and other hardware.   “We know that corporations have become certainly healthier in the last two or three years by a long shot, but we don’t yet see a real sustained spending pattern coming from enterprises yet on their IT infrastructure,” he said.    Delaney said with markets tight, Celestica’s acquisition strategy is focused on deals that diversify its client base away from often volatile information technology and communications markets. An example is its purchase last year of Manufacturers’ Services Ltd.   “We’ll always be watching this space, but where we’ll probably spend our M&A (mergers and acquisitions) money will be on bringing us some distinctive new capabilities,” he said.   Celestica has said it hopes to increase its revenues from industrial, automotive, aerospace and consumer markets to 30 from 20 percent, though Delaney said on Tuesday he expects this to take a couple of years.   The chief executive said he hopes Celestica is through with a series of costly restructurings, shedding more than 20,000 workers since the tech bubble burst. It announced plans in January to cut another 5,500 workers in the next 15 months.   “We’ll have 85 percent of our people in low-cost geographies. How much more is there? You’ve got to ask that question. The reality is this thing is going to tail off pretty dramatically,” he said.   Besides restructuring costs, Delaney said the company could use its $969 million in cash to repay about $250 million of convertible debt maturing in the summer, although this was only one option.   “Frankly we’ll look at our growth prospects here and where our cash might go. Are there M&A opportunities? ... is there growth coming from the market that is going to require working capital?” he said   “We’ll keep a healthy amount of cash around to support those kind of growth prospects.”   Celestica shares closed up 30 cents at $13.16 in New York. In Toronto it rose 57 Canadian cents to C$16.37.  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

19,Production Moving from China-Flextronics,(Corrects region in sixth paragraph.),2005-03-02T01:19:23+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-flextronics-a/corrected-production-moving-from-china-flextronics-idUSN0140770920050302," (Corrects region in sixth paragraph.)   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electronics production may shift closer to countries that consume such goods as manufacturing costs rise in China, the chief executive of Flextronics International Ltd., the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, said on Tuesday.   The U.S. government has called for China to reevaluate its yuan, saying that the current peg to the U.S. dollar is artificially low, making U.S. products less competitive.   If China lets the yuan appreciate, manufacturing costs there will increase, hurting companies who are rushing out to build factories there, Flextronics CEO Michael Marks told the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   “I think China is overdone,” said Marks, who employs more than 40,000 workers in the country, making everything from computer discs to mobile phone cameras. “I think some of these guys (rivals) are rushing off to China now and it has peaked.”   China has recently surpassed the United States as the world’s top destination for investment.   Stephen Delaney, chief executive of Celestica Inc., the world’s No. 4 contract electronics maker, is also cautious on China, saying that transportation could be costly under tight deadlines. The company has closed plants in the United States and Canada, exporting those jobs to Mexico, Eastern Europe, and Asia.   Investment in manufacturing will likely be pulled from Asia to Eastern Europe in the next five years if the yuan and other Asian currencies appreciate and transportation costs climb as a result of soaring oil prices, Marks said.   Investment in Mexico has started growing. Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Poland and Romania are expected to see a flush of investment as well, according to Marks.   “Their prices are relatively close to Asia prices, but you’re 24 hours by truck to the UK,” Marks said.   It takes about a week for goods to travel from China to the United States.   A potential currency shift is not expected to hurt Flextronics, Marks said, partly because the company’s business is diversified among other low-cost regions. Flextronics, which has been in China for at least 10 years, uses profits generated out of China to grow its business there so a currency shift will not change its investment costs, Marks said.

22,mit-Web Search Technology Still in Early Stages,"Web search technology and services still have a long way to go to fulfill users' needs, executives at Microsoft and Yahoo said on Tuesday.",2005-03-01T22:44:14+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-search-dc/reuters-summit-web-search-technology-still-in-early-stages-idUSN0138934420050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Web search technology and services still have a long way to go to fulfill users’ needs, executives at Microsoft and Yahoo said on Tuesday.   “It’s still early in this category,” Christopher Payne, the vice president in charge of search at Microsoft Corp.’s MSN Internet division, said at the Reuters Technology Summit.   Microsoft Corp. recently launched its own search engine, Yahoo Corp. revamped its search-based advertising services on Tuesday, and Google Inc. has steadily added new features to its popular Web search engine, including the ability to search for video content.   The face-off between these three companies in the search arena is one of the most closely watched contests in the technology and Internet industry.   “If you think about the future, it is about content, it is about search,” Yahoo Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig. said.   In response to Google’s emergence as the Web’s most popular search engine, as well as a lucrative business model based on text advertising displayed alongside search results, Microsoft and Yahoo have ramped up their technologies to grab a chunk of the estimated $5 billion search services market.   “We have been in the search business for a year now. Search is continuing to evolve pretty dramatically,” Rosensweig said, adding that Yahoo is incorporating content from its other Web-based services into search results.   Yahoo is opening up its search engine so that other programmers can develop software applications that tap into search information. Yahoo also said the Overture business, which it acquired in 2003 to offer search-based advertising, would be rebranded as Yahoo Search Marketing Solutions.   Despite claims that search engines are still in their infancy, Microsoft’s Payne said it would be difficult for any new players to enter the playing field and change the game, much as Google did after it debuted in 1998.   “It will be difficult to do what Google did,” Payne said. “The cost now of getting into this category is high.”   Payne said Microsoft’s research division, which has an annual budget of nearly $7 billion, has been given search as a top priority. He said the company would eventually work to make search a more integral part of the Windows, beginning with the next version of the desktop operating system, code-named Longhorn, due out in 2006.   With regard to newer search-related services, all three companies have released trial versions of search software that allow users to search through files and information stored on their hard drives.   The next step is to tailor search results to a user’s particular interests and needs, Payne said.   “Every search (right now) is like a blind date,” Payne said.   Both executives said there was an opportunity to expand search services by delivering such capabilities to cell phones.   Payne said wireless search services were a potential growth area, but it was not yet clear how search providers would be able to make money from such services.

23,mit-Celestica Sees Muted 1st-Half Demand,Celestica Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Delaney said on Tuesday he expects growth in the electronics markets served by his company and its clients to be weaker in the first half than a year earlier.,2005-03-01T22:32:22+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-celestica-dc/reuters-summit-celestica-sees-muted-1st-half-demand-idUSN0138644220050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Celestica Inc.  Chief Executive Stephen Delaney said on Tuesday he expects growth in the electronics markets served by his company and its clients to be weaker in the first half than a year earlier.   Celestica, the world’s No. 4 contract electronics manufacturer, makes electronic parts for such companies as IBM, Cisco, Sun Microsystems and Lucent.   “I don’t see the first half of 2005 looking as good as the first half of 2004 looked,” Delaney said at the Reuters Technology Summit.   “The basic principle that we’re all working with, meaning us and our customers, is that we’re probably seeing end-market growth in the low single-digit range for the first half of the year,” he said. “Nobody’s radar is any good past that.”   While some industry analysts predict a second-half recovery, Delaney said he thinks it is too early to tell. As a result he said he is keeping operations at his Toronto-based company at “fighting weight” rather than expanding capacity.   Delaney said one cap on growth was the cautious spending patterns of major companies when it comes to upgrading technology like servers and other hardware.   “We know that corporations have become certainly healthier in the last two or three years by a long shot, but we don’t yet see a real sustained spending pattern coming from enterprises yet on their IT infrastructure,” he said.    Delaney said with markets tight, Celestica’s acquisition strategy is focused on deals that diversify its client base away from often volatile information technology and communications markets. An example is its purchase last year of Manufacturers’ Services Ltd.   “We’ll always be watching this space, but where we’ll probably spend our M&A (mergers and acquisitions) money will be on bringing us some distinctive new capabilities,” he said.   Celestica has said it hopes to increase its revenues from industrial, automotive, aerospace and consumer markets to 30 from 20 percent, though Delaney said on Tuesday he expects this to take a couple of years.   The chief executive said he hopes Celestica is through with a series of costly restructurings, shedding more than 20,000 workers since the tech bubble burst. It announced plans in January to cut another 5,500 workers in the next 15 months.   “We’ll have 85 percent of our people in low-cost geographies. How much more is there? You’ve got to ask that question. The reality is this thing is going to tail off pretty dramatically,” he said.   Besides restructuring costs, Delaney said the company could use its $969 million in cash to repay about $250 million of convertible debt maturing in the summer, although this was only one option.   “Frankly we’ll look at our growth prospects here and where our cash might go. Are there M&A opportunities? ... is there growth coming from the market that is going to require working capital?” he said   “We’ll keep a healthy amount of cash around to support those kind of growth prospects.”   Celestica shares closed up 30 cents at $13.16 in New York. In Toronto it rose 57 Canadian cents to C$16.37.  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

24,r the Wicked or the Weary or Tech CEO,Sinking prices. A fruitless search for new ideas. Products that pass their technological prime far too quickly.,2005-03-01T20:24:43+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-concerns-dc/no-sleep-for-the-wicked-or-the-weary-or-tech-ceo-idUSN2831602020050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sinking prices. A fruitless search for new ideas. Products that pass their technological prime far too quickly.   These are the fears that keep technology executives awake, these are the fears that make them quake. They are part of the frightful realization that no matter how big the cash stockpile or how well-trained the work force, no chief executive is ever truly in control.   In interviews with Reuters, several senior executives of suppliers of software, hardware and technology services described a litany of worries that keep them up at night.   In the rapidly changing world of technology, when one year’s hit could be next year’s dud, the fear of watching one’s products lose customer interest was a common theme discussed by the executives, speaking at the Reuters Technology Summit.   Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was recently spun off by Motorola Inc., has existed just a few months as an independent entity. When asked what keeps him up at night, newly installed Chief Executive Michel Mayer barely hesitated: “So many things! How do you make sure that a few years from now what you have is still in demand?”   He said he feels an ongoing push to keep costs down so as to keep the company’s products priced competitively.   “What keeps me up is, how do I keep my company competitive from a cost point of view?” Mayer said.   Looming above most fears was perhaps the greatest concern of all: not innovating quickly enough.   “What keeps most of the executives up at night is really thinking about how do we get more innovative ideas out on the market,” said John Chen, chief executive of Sybase Inc., which sells database software to businesses. “There’s not really any big exciting ideas today.”   Take the personal computer. Despite hundreds of millions of computers sold each year, the biggest innovation in PC technology seems to be making them smaller and cheaper, not finding an innovative new use for them, Chen said.   “There are how many ways to add value to the PC?” he asked. “Right now it’s just ‘Get cheaper machines, get more powerful, smaller footprints.’ What we’re doing is meaningful but not exciting.”    Halfway around the world in India, where hundreds of thousands of newly graduated engineers are waking up each day to jobs handling business services for U.S. companies, the notion of pricing pressure isn’t a fear, it’s a business model.   But even Tata Consultancy Services, India’s biggest software services exporter, has its own fears about the matter. Facing increased competition from new local entrants, a top TCS executive said he tosses and turns about his services becoming low-value commodities.   Arup Gupta, the head of TCS’s North American operation, said he worries that the company’s growing expertise in areas such as stock exchange technology is not boosting the company’s reputation, which remains largely tied to India’s perceived chief asset as a place where engineers will work for pennies on the dollar.   The solution? Not only is it finding niche areas of expertise and offering more valuable services like analysis and forecasting, he said, but it’s something virtually any U.S. corporate honcho can comprehend: building a brand.   “Does that reflect in the brand we are creating? Is that message going out, the amount of expertise the company has built?” Gupta said. “For that to happen our name needs to be known.”  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

25,mit-Vonage Sees Future in Wireless,"Vonage Holdings Corp., the largest seller of consumer Internet-based telephone service, said on Tuesday it was exploring ways to allow its customers to use the service over cellular phone networks.",2005-03-01T19:20:29+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-vonage-dc/reuters-summit-vonage-sees-future-in-wireless-idUSN0136911520050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp., the largest seller of consumer Internet-based telephone service, said on Tuesday it was exploring ways to allow its customers to use the service over cellular phone networks.   Vonage Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Citron said the company had held talks for roaming agreements with all the major cellular companies, but the technological hurdles remained high.   Vonage’s customers plug phones into specially designed Internet adapters that convert voice calls into data sent over the Web, a technology that Vonage sees as more efficient than dedicated voice lines that traditional phones use.   Later this year, Vonage will offer a telephone handset with Vonage software that transmits calls over Wi-Fi wireless Internet connections. Citron said that while the handset was not meant to replace a cell phone, Vonage would eventually like to have such handsets be able to use cellular networks.   “Further out, a couple of years down the road, it may very well be a business for us,” Citron said at the Reuters Technology Summit. “I’m really thinking of ‘06 and ‘07 as we grow up as a company.”   Several companies have explored the possible merging of cellular networks with Wi-Fi usage in a portable telephone, aiming to offer cheaper mobile calls.   SBC Communications has said its Cingular Wireless joint venture will offer cell phones in a few years that will be able to make calls over home Wi-Fi networks running SBC’s high-speed Internet service.   Towerstream, a start-up wireless Internet service provider, said on Tuesday it would test a wide-area Wi-Fi network in New York designed with voice over Wi-Fi calling in mind.   Citron said it would make sense for a cellular service company to partner with Vonage for such a service because of Vonage’s large customer base. Vonage said in January it had hit 400,000 lines, and Citron said the company’s growth rate had accelerated during the first quarter to “well over” 10,000 lines per week.   Privately-held Vonage has raised $208 million in venture capital to date, and Citron said the company has about $100 million on hand. By renting network resources, Vonage has kept its capital costs low. It spends much of its free cash flow on marketing to attract new users.   Citron declined to comment on the company’s prospects for an initial public offering. He did say the market for consumer voice over Internet protocol, or VOIP, would consolidate as minor players pull out, and that Vonage would consider acquisitions but does not see much worth buying at this point.   Vonage has seen some of its customers’ calls blocked by their Internet service provider. Citron said two or three companies had blocked some of Vonage’s traffic, and that it could be up to Congress to mandate open access to U.S. broadband networks.   “We really view it as a censorship problem,” Citron said. “If these operators are going to go through and doing this to VOIP, what stops them from censoring your content?”   (News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered throughout the day Monday through Wednesday to Reuters terminals and to the Reuters.com Web site, http://reuters.com) All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

26,mit: Yahoo Seeks Content as It Expands in LA - COO,"Yahoo Inc. is expanding in Los Angeles and inking content deals with television producers, but don't look for YahooTV, Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig said on Tuesday.",2005-03-01T19:20:01+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-yahoo-dc/reuters-summit-yahoo-seeks-content-as-it-expands-in-la-coo-idUSN3136972420050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. is expanding in Los Angeles and inking content deals with television producers, but don’t look for YahooTV, Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig said on Tuesday.   Yahoo has been embracing Hollywood since hiring former Hollywood studio chief Terry Semel to run the Sunnyvale, California-based company in 2001. Earlier this year, Yahoo said it would double its presence in Los Angeles to be closer to the action.   “Why not be where the center of creativity is, where those partnerships can be?” Rosensweig said at the Reuters Technology Summit, noting that the company has about 2,000 employees in Southern California, primarily in its Web search advertising unit.   Yahoo in November hired Lloyd Braun, a former chairman of Walt Disney Co.’s ABC Entertainment Television Group, to head its media and entertainment division, sparking speculation that the company could be moving into television.   “We don’t intend to replace TV. TV does a great job of being TV,” said Rosensweig, who added that online entertainment is now brimming with opportunities, from music and online gaming to traditional and user-generated content — areas where Yahoo already has businesses.   Rosensweig declined to predict what shape the company’s entertainment strategy would take, but said he did expect to see more deals like the one struck in September with reality television outfit Mark Burnett Productions.   “A great deal of it is going to be continued partnerships with big content providers,” Rosensweig said.   As part of the deal with Burnett, Yahoo integrates exclusive content from “The Apprentice” television show throughout its site. Yahoo makes money from the deal by selling advertising around the content. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2022 Reuters.

Celestica, the world’s No. 4 contract electronics manufacturer, makes electronic parts for such companies as IBM, Cisco, Sun Microsystems and Lucent.   “I don’t see first half of 2005 looking as good as the first half of 2004 looked,” Delaney said at the Reuters Technology Summit.   “The basic principle that we’re all working with, meaning us and our customers, is that we’re probably seeing end-market growth in the low single-digit range for the first half of the year. Nobody’s radar is any good past that.”  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

Computer Associates, one of the world’s largest software makers, has grown over the years through more than 50 acquisitions, but it has refrained from large deals as it contended with government investigation into its accounting. Clarke said CA aimed for more acquisitions.   The company, based in Islandia, New York, has accelerated the consolidation of its existing portfolio of more than 2,000 products. Clarke said the company plans to shave about 5 percent to 10 percent of products annually, and more than that for the next couple of years. It plans to more than make up the lost revenue through organic growth and acquisitions.   Analysts have said the strategy makes sense because Computer Associates’ main businesses — system management and storage software — are not growing much.   “Growing the business itself is very hard,” said Nistan Hargin, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.   Clarke said Computer Associates’ balance sheet is the strongest it has been in eight years. CA recently named two executives to focus on acquisitions.   “We’ve traditionally used our cash for acquisitions,” Clarke said. “For acquisitions under $1 billion it will be more accretive to our shareholders if we use cash.”   CA’s stock has risen since it settled federal accounting fraud charges in September. But Clarke said he believes the stock is still undervalued, so he prefers to use cash to buy companies. Computer Associates will look for deals that would add to its cash flow cash flow within a year or two, he said.   Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Gregg Moskowitz said, “As long as they pay attention to the return on capital, then an acquisition is likely to be a positive.”   In the past year, Computer Associates has changed most of its executive suite, bringing in IBM veteran John Swainson as its CEO and Dell’s Chief Accounting Officer Robert Davis as CFO.   Its former CEO Sanjay Kumar was indicted and former CFO Ira Zar pleaded guilty to charges related to the accounting problems last year.

29,ees Margin Targets in 18 Months,"Newly public microchip maker Freescale Semiconductor Ins. should be able to hit its broad target range for profit margins within a year and a half, Chief Executive Michel Mayer said on Monday.",2005-03-01T15:05:50+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-freescale-dc/freescale-sees-margin-targets-in-18-months-idUSN2828838920050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Newly public microchip maker Freescale Semiconductor Ins. should be able to hit its broad target range for profit margins within a year and a half, Chief Executive Michel Mayer said on Monday.   Mayer said inventory problems that plagued the chip sector in 2004 were still being worked through in the networking segment, but his company’s exposure was less severe than that of some competitors.   Freescale’s general target is to produce gross profit margins at 45 percent at the peaks of chip industry cycles and about 40 percent at the bottom of those cycles, Mayer said.   “I’d be disappointed if I’m not there in say 18 months or less,” Mayer said at the Reuters Technology Summit. “It’s not five years.”   Freescale, spun off from Motorola Inc. in a two-part process that started with its IPO last July, derives about half of its business from the automotive segment and home appliances, while the rest is a mix of computer processing and chips for cellular handsets.   Mayer said the phone chip market appeared to be too crowded, especially as third-generation, or 3G, high-speed networks are put in place.   “TI, Qualcomm, us, Infineon, ST Micro, Broadcom, Intel — there’s a lot of competition for something that’s pretty clearly defined and has quite a lot of investment,” he said.   “That’s a space where frankly as we get to 3G and the dust clears I expect a few people to drop off and I expect some consolidation.”   In the meantime Mayer said he was comfortable with Freescale’s inventory levels, running around 10-1/2 to 11 weeks, though he said there was still overhang from 2004, where distributors found themselves oversupplied.   “In networking there is still a little bit of flush going on probably ... so I think we’re not completely healthy yet,” Mayer said at the Reuters event in San Francisco.   And with relatively little time on its own, Mayer said he still had work to do to shape Freescale into its own entity.   “I need to create a new company, more energetic ... a little bit more oomph than Motorola Semiconductor had.”  (Additional reporting by Duncan Martell and Dan Sorid)  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

30, U.S. Plasma TV Strategy Succeeding,"Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which sells consumer devices under the Panasonic brand, said on Monday that its six month-long push to sell more plasma flat-panel televisions is going better than expected.",2005-03-01T14:35:21+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-matsushita-dc/matsushita-u-s-plasma-tv-strategy-succeeding-idUSN2827092120050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Japan’s Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which sells consumer devices under the Panasonic brand, said on Monday that its six month-long push to sell more plasma flat-panel televisions is going better than expected.   “We have kept the number one position in plasma TV sales (at U.S. retailers) for 25 of the last 26 weeks,” Yoshi Yamada, chief executive of Matsushita’s North American subsidiary, told the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   Matsushita’s regional unit here was renamed Panasonic Corporation of North America last year to better reflect its brand and reach in the market, Yamada said.   Although Matsushita is a leader in Japan’s cellphone market and posted a 24 percent jump in operating profit in its latest fiscal quarter on strong sales of home appliances, the company as a whole is putting its focus domestically and internationally on growing its plasma TV business, Yamada said.   Matsushita made a strategic decision to use plasma technology, costs more,  for televisions larger than 37 inches to deliver better-quality pictures, Yamada said.   While some U.S. consumers may prefer to buy flat-panel televisions for in the $1,500 range, many are also willing to spend nearly twice that amount for better quality, Yamada said.   “To the same extent there are so many people who are looking for the product beyond the price” such as features, performance and trust in the brand, Yamada said.   For Panasonic’s next fiscal year, which begins in April, Yamada said that he expects plasma TV sales to grow two and a half times from the previous year as the company triples its advertising budget. Yamada did not provide specific sales figures.   Several analysts have recently cut their investment ratings on Matsushita due to concerns its earnings will be weighed down by sluggish demand for semiconductors, slower growth in its mobile phone division and sliding prices of consumer electronics.   Despite adopting the Panasonic brand as its main identity in North America, Yamada said that there were no plans to introduce the company’s cell phones or home appliances here.   “We are not chasing all markets at one time,” Yamada said, “I don’t think it is the right time at the moment.”  Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco and

31, Executives at the Reuters Tech Summit,"Top executives and analysts from the worlds of software, semiconductors and consumer electronics spoke about a range of topics on Monday at the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.",2005-03-01T14:31:54+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-quotes-dc/quotes-from-executives-at-the-reuters-tech-summit-idUSN2830808120050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top executives and analysts from the worlds of software, semiconductors and consumer electronics spoke about a range of topics on Monday at the Reuters Technology Summit in San Francisco.   Below are a few key comments on subjects like acquisitions, valuation:    “I really expect the new CEO to come in and say — get growing” — Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds of the next top executive at Hewlett-Packard Co., which earlier this month ousted its controversial CEO Carly Fiorina.   “Significant reduction in headcount in PCs (at HP) is something that’s needed,” he said.    “I think Mike would be a good CEO for almost any technology company” — Computer Associates COO Jeff Clarke on MCI’s Michael Capellas as a candidate for HP. “He has an extraordinary track record at HP, Compaq and now MCI.”    “I need to create a new company, more energetic...a little bit more oomph than Motorola Semiconductor had” — Freescale Semiconductor Chief Executive Michel Mayer on molding his company after its spin-off from Motorola.    “They’re more committed to — this is kind of a mean thing to say honestly — I think they’re more committed to us failing than customers succeeding and that’s why they’re failing” - Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff on competitor Siebel.   “Their numbers are terrible. They’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars. What do they have to show for it?”    “There’s not really any big exciting ideas today and that’s not to say it won’t happen. Right now it’s just this gets cheaper, machines get more powerful, you have a smaller footprint. What we’re doing is meaningful but not exciting” — Sybase CEO John Chen on the level of innovation in information technology.    “We believe on several metrics we’re undervalued. Our stock is relatively undervalued against our clients and our peer group” — Computer Associates COO Jeff Clarke.    “We are going to definitely look at acquisitions. But if we do acquire just a large consulting company there are a lot of challenges, among them meshing corporate cultures” — Arup Gupta, CEO of Tata Consulting Services U.S.  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered

32,See Few Innovations as Cash Builds,"U.S. technology executives see mounting piles of cash but limited areas for new investment, which may fuel further consolidation in the sector, executives said at the Reuters Technology Summit.",2005-03-01T14:28:36+0000,https://www.reuters.com/news/article/specialeventii-tech-summit-outlook-dc/tech-execs-see-few-innovations-as-cash-builds-idUSN2823841420050301," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. technology executives see mounting piles of cash but limited areas for new investment, which may fuel further consolidation in the sector, executives said at the Reuters Technology Summit.   “There’s not really any big exciting ideas today,” Sybase Inc. Chief Executive John Chen told the summit in San Francisco on Monday. “What we’re doing is meaningful but not exciting.”   Asked how many big innovations were around the corner in consumer electronics, Panasonic Corp. North America Chief Executive Yoshi Yamada said, “How many? None.” Panasonic is a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd. .   And in a report released on Monday at the summit, Gartner Inc. warned that the $200-billion-a-year semiconductor industry should brace for two years of overcapacity and increased price pressure.   “We’re returning now to a more stable growth rate of 3 to 5 percent. We’ve become a mature industry,” Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds told Reuters.   Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro said fast-growing sectors like storage could consolidate. Apple Computer Inc. with its iPod and disk drive maker Seagate Technology, which can’t keep up demand for its latest disk drives, are notable exceptions in her sector, she said.   “Everyone is looking for something that is exciting and they don’t see it,” she said at a Goldman Sachs technology conference last week.   Some companies are looking for ways to invest.   A Reuters Estimates study of cash holdings at the top 2,000 global tech companies shows that nearly two-thirds of the $432 billion held by these companies at the end of last year is in the hands of the top 50.   The top 15 companies alone hold more cash than the bottom 1,950 — $174.8 billion compared with $161.6 billion, according to the study.   Heading the list is Microsoft Corp., with twice the cash of second-ranked Intel. Nokia follows in third position, then Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc., Ericsson, IBM, Dell Inc., Oracle Corp., Canon Inc., Alcatel and Apple.   But the number of companies with cash to make a buy are limited. Only 73 have more than $1 billion in cash.   “When industries mature, scale starts to matter,” said Michel Mayer, chief executive of Freescale Semiconductor Inc., the third-largest U.S. electronic chipmaker, which was spun off in 2004 by Motorola.   “Consolidation is probably coming, with prices moving lower,” Kip Bedard, investor relations director of Micron Technology Inc., said of expected declines in memory chips, Micron’s core business.   For its own part, Micron remains well-heeled with about $1.2 billion in cash.   (Additional reporting by Duncan Martell)  News from the Reuters Technology Summit will be delivered
